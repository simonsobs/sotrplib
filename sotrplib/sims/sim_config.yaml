# Simulation configuration for creating simulated maps

#Most of the inputs are self explanatory. 
#If you are creating simulated maps, the n_realizations parameter under `maps`
#is the number of map realizations to run.

#The center_ra and center_dec parameters define the center of the map in degrees.
#The width_ra and width_dec parameters define the HALF WIDTH of the map in degrees.

#map_noise is the rms of the Gaussian white noise. Currently the only option.
#min and max times set the limits of the map Unix times. In the pipeline the 
#current implementation is to use np.linspace to choose the times in between
#the min and max times.

# The `injected_sources` section defines the parameters for the static sources.
# Although you can inject an arbitrary number of sources, the photutils method
# also sets a minimum distance between sources. A warning will be raised if
# the number of sources injected is less than the requested number due to overcrowding.
# Sources are injected with a uniform random distribution of fluxes between the
# min_flux and max_flux parameters. The inj_fwhm parameter sets the FWHM of the
# sources in arcminutes. The fwhm_uncert_frac parameter sets the fractional size of
# the range in allowed variation of FWHM, i.e. so that the FWHM of the injected sources
# will be uniformly random between fwhm*(1-fwhm_uncert_frac) and fwhm*(1+fwhm_uncert_frac).

# The `injected_transients` section defines the parameters for the transients, which 
# just means a Gaussian flare at a certain time, with a certain width and amplitude.
# Currently only Gaussian flares are supported (as of April 2025).

# While static sources are injected into each map, the transient objects are
# only injected into maps in which they are both visible and flaring (+- 3*flare_width).
# The min_width and max_width parameters set the range of flare FWHMs.
# Time ranges set the peak flare location (i.e. mean of the Gaussian).

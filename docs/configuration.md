# Configuration

Configuration for the main pipeline runner `sotrp` is provided by a JSON
file. This JSON file is de-serialized by the code in 
`sotrplib/config/config.py`, which is a Pydantic Settings model.

More information will be provided in the future as the configuration
becomes more permanent.
